        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <div>

        <p> I am a 20 year old Albanian adult boy who moved to the United States three years ago. Originally I was born in Kosovo, so my home language is Albanian. Now, I am a student at Raritan Valley Community College, and majoring in Information Technology. I've been interested in technology and enjoy learning about new advancements in the field. My passion though, continue to be sports, especially soccer, which has been a significant part of my whole life. I've played for a team back in Kosovo, and I continued to play alone when I moved to the United States. The love for the sport has motivated me to stay active, work hard, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. When I first moved to the United States, I couldn't speak a single word, and still today I feel not adapted to this new environment. Now I've learned English well, and I can speak Albanian fluently. The people here made me not enjoy the state at the most, but I still continue to learn about different cultures. So, I am a very motivated person and passionate about sports and technology. I am not the best for technology, but I try my best to make my family happy since I am the first person in the family who has gone to college. I am committed to my studies and I hope to pursue a career in the IT field, for a better future for myself and make my parents as proud as I can. Being far away from my home country, suffering adapting in a new place, motivated me to continue and try any opportunities the United States can offer me. I am not going to be proud of myself until I can keep a constitency of happiness in my family. So, this is me, Lirik Salihu!  </p>

        <h2>CSS ANIMATIONS</h2>

        <div>

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the primary language used for styling and designing websites. CSS animations, a subset of CSS3, allows web developers to add dynamic visual effects to websites, without the need for JavaScript or other programming languages. CSS animations are not only visually appealing but also enhance user experience, making websites more engaging and interactive.</p>

            <p>CSS animations are created by defining a set of keyframes. Keyframes are specific points in time where a CSS property changes its value. For example, a keyframe may define the starting point of an animation as 0%, where the background color is white, and the ending point as 100%, where the background color changes to black. By defining multiple keyframes, developers can create complex animations with multiple stages.</p>
            
            <p>There are several benefits to using CSS animations. Firstly, they are lightweight, meaning they do not require external libraries or frameworks to work. This means that websites load faster, resulting in a better user experience.</p>
            
            <p>Secondly, CSS animations are more efficient than JavaScript animations because they use the browser's hardware acceleration to render the animation. JavaScript animations, on the other hand, can cause performance issues, especially on older devices or slower internet connections.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, CSS animations are easier to implement than JavaScript animations. Developers with a basic understanding of CSS can create simple animations without the need for additional libraries or frameworks. This makes CSS animations a powerful tool for web developers who want to add dynamic visual effects to their websites quickly.</p>
            
            <p>CSS animations are a powerful tool for web developers who want to add dynamic visual effects to their websites. They are lightweight, efficient, and easy to implement, making them a popular choice for web designers. By defining keyframes and customizing the duration, delay, and timing function, developers can create complex animations that enhance the user experience. With the increasing importance of user experience in web design, CSS animations are a valuable skill for any web developer to learn.</p>
